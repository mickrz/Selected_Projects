# Selected Projects

I try to spend time every day to learn something new where much of it has come from MOOC projects the past 2-3 years. It ranges from Machine Learning, Deep Learning to Android App Development to Algorithms. I'm going through everything to add more notes and add more visuals where appropriate.

* **[Traffic Sign Classifier (Self-driving car Nanodegree)](https://github.com/mickrz/SelfDrivingCarNanoDegree/blob/master/term1/Project2%20-%20Traffic%20Sign%20Classifier/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html)
I utilized a homebrew convolutional neural network (CNN) to train on traffic signs to predict the input images using Python and scikit-learn. Training achieved 98.6% accuracy by tweaking the hyperparameters and the model was able to identify the traffic signs in the test set.


* **[Behavioral Cloning (Self-driving car Nanodegree)](https://github.com/mickrz/SelfDrivingCarNanoDegree/blob/master/term1/Project3%20-%20Behavioral%20Cloning/writeup_report.md)
I utilized a convolutional neural network (CNN) model Nvidia published and I augmented images using OpenCV from the original dataset to train the model in which a car was able to drive around a previously unseen track successfully in a simulation. This was a particularly difficult challenge because my sluggish CPU and video resolution. When running the test after training, it was problematic because the model couldn't reliably get a result fast enough and the car would oscillate. Lowering the video resolution minimized the performance issue. It demonstrated how important having a good development environment is to train and test to get a reproducible result.


* **[Cybercrime 101 with a focus on Identity Theft](https://github.com/mickrz/OtherInterestingStuff/blob/master/CybercrimeIDTheftAndPrevention.pdf)
I researched, wrote and presented this to my flotilla of the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary after a personal experience I had. It was a lot of fun to research and organize this presentation. I probably spent about 80-100 hours on it but I liked how it came together. It's a bit dated now given this area, but much is still relevant. There are some links to videos off of the FTC website that are not linked in the presentation. I've listed them below for reference.

* **[A* Algorithm (Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree)](https://github.com/mickrz/Data_Structures_And_Algorithms/blob/master/Project4/Astar.py)
The implementation for A* algorithm was required for the final project in this nanodegree. This was one of the many fun ones to do. Conceptually, it is easy to understand since it combines the Djikstra and Greedy Best-frist-Search. My implementation is problably a little different than is typically done as I used recursion. It seemed appropriate and I reinforced many of the concepts learned in the program.


* **mewd (description only - more to come...)
This project was born out of my Android Developer Nanodegree Capstone project as a way to give back for the opportunity and gratefulness of receiving my scholarship. I'm  currently developing an app that enables users to enter how they are feeling and what factors are causing that feeling. Also at any point in time, an inspirational quote can be read when a pick-me-up is needed. The app is targeted for everyone, but anyone suffering from mental health issues may find this beneficial for tracking over time and presenting to their health care professional. (Google Play store launch in Q3/Q4 2019; other app stores in 2020)
